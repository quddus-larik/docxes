Multi-Version Documentation Support - Version Discovery: Automatically detects versions based on the directory structure in the content folder. - Version-Specific Navigation: Generates independent navigation trees for each version. - Production Manifest: In production, it can load a pre-built manifest.json for near-instant routing and content retrieval. 2. Advanced MDX Processing - Compiler Pipeline: Uses `next-mdx-remote` to transform MDX into serializable output. - Frontmatter Extraction: Built-in support for `gray-matter` to handle page metadata `(title, description, order, etc.)`. - Syntax Highlighting: Integrated `rehype-pretty-code` for beautiful code blocks with theme customization (defaulting to `github-dark`). - Automatic ID Generation: Uses `rehype-slug` to ensure all headings are linkable. 3. Smart Caching System - Granular Invalidation: Uses `SHA-256` hashing to track changes in source content, MDX configuration, plugin lists, and slugify logic. - Persistence: A `CacheManager` stores processed results in a `.docxes` directory to avoid redundant compilations. 4. Extensible Plugin Architecture - Lifecycle Hooks: Provides four strategic hooks for third-party extensions: - beforeParse: Modify raw strings before parsing. - afterParse: Manipulate the `Markdown AST` or `frontmatter`. - beforeCompile: Transform content right before MDX compilation. - afterRender: Post-process the compiled output. 5. Automated Content Intelligence - TOC Generation: A dedicated AST visitor `(ast/toc.ts)` extracts headings to build hierarchical Table of Contents. - Search Indexing: Generates a comprehensive search index including `titles, descriptions, keywords, and searchable plain-text content`. - Automatic Navigation: Infers hierarchy from file paths and respects an order property in frontmatter for manual sorting. 6. Developer Tooling (CLI) - Build Command: A binary utility to pre-compile the entire documentation site and export a static search index to public/ folder named `search-index.json` with use of tsx command. - Clean Command: Quickly clears the engine's cache by tsx. - Flexible Config: Supports a custom slugify function and configurable document paths via `x-meta.config.tsx`. 7. Content Management - Hidden Files: Automatically ignores files prefixed with . or containing `.hidden` (e.g., comparison.hidden.mdx). - Flexible Entry Points: Supports both filename.mdx and `folder/main.mdx` patterns. ![Programiz](https://cdn.playground-v2.programiz.com/assets/logos/logo.svg)"}]
