## Directory Structure

All documentation files are located in the `content/docs` directory, organized by version.

```text
content/docs/
  v1/
    introduction.mdx
    getting-started.mdx
    advanced/
      deep-dive.mdx
```

## Creating Pages

To create a new page, simply add an `.mdx` or `.md` file in the appropriate version directory. The URL will automatically match the file path.

### Frontmatter

Each page should include frontmatter at the top:

```markdown
---
title: My New Page
description: A brief description of what this page covers.
keywords: ["guide","learn", "configuration","etc"]
order: 5
---
```

- **title**: The display title of the page.
- **description**: Used for SEO and page headers.
- **order**: Controls the position in the sidebar navigation.
- **keywords**: Used for Searching by keywords have data-type of Array with strings elements.

## Navigation & Hierarchy

DocXes automatically generates the sidebar based on your file structure.
- **Files**: Become individual links.
- **Folders**: Become expandable sections.
- **main.mdx**: If a folder contains a `main.mdx`, the folder name itself becomes a clickable link.

## Hide files and folder

Some consumers need to hide files but, for later edit or recovery then what shoud the do because there is no any js object based sidebar content.

We Provide a File Naming hide techs that give tha full control over visiblity on content documentations.
- **Files**: Rename File from `code.mdx` to `code.hidden.mdx`
- **Folder**: Rename `foldername` from `foldername.hidden.mdx`

## Customization Guardrails

DocXes is designed to be a "low-touch" framework. For the best experience and easiest upgrades, follow these guidelines:

### ✅ Safe to Edit
These are the files you *should* modify to customize your documentation site:
- `x-meta.config.tsx`: Your primary control center. Change themes, site info, and UI overrides here.
- `content/docs/`: All your MDX/Markdown content goes here.
- `marketplace/`: Create or modify themes here.
- `public/`: Add your assets, logos, and favicons.

### ⚠️ Warning: Core Files
Avoid editing these unless you are confident in extending the framework:
- `app/`: Contains the routing and layout logic.
- `lib/`: Core utilities for document parsing and API responses (It has no core NPM packages).
- `hooks/`: Framework state management (sidebar, TOC, search).
- `components/ui/`: Standard UI primitives (ShadnCN UI).
