The Docxes Engine (@core/engine/\*\*) differs from the Nextra Engine primarily in its architectural philosophy: Docxes is
a "Content-as-Data" processor, whereas Nextra is a "File-to-Page" transformer.

Here is a comparison focused strictly on the processing logic, excluding UI and framework integrations:

1. Processing Philosophy

- Docxes (Manifest-Driven): The engine acts as a standalone compiler that treats documentation as structured data. It
  proactively "walks" the filesystem to generate a Global Manifest (manifest.json) and a search index. This allows the
  UI to be entirely decoupled—the engine provides a "Content API" that the frontend simply consumes.
- Nextra (Loader-Driven): Nextra's processing is traditionally tied to the build-tooling (Webpack/Turbo/Vite). It
  transforms MDX files into Next.js pages on-the-fly. The "engine" is effectively a set of sophisticated plugins that
  inject metadata into the module system.

3. Key Technical Differentiators

- Granular Plugin Hooks: Docxes defines explicit lifecycle hooks (beforeParse, afterParse, beforeCompile, afterRender).
  This is more akin to a compiler like Vite than a static site generator.
- Search Indexing: Docxes generates a flat, searchable JSON array of the entire documentation set during the build
  phase. Nextra typically relies on a separate "page map" and often requires client-side execution to build its search
  index.
- Data Portability: Because Docxes compiles to serializable JSON (DocxesOutput), the "processed" content can be sent
  over the wire (API) or stored in a DB. Nextra's output is code (JS), making it harder to use in a "Headless" CMS
  fashion.

4. Internal Structure Comparison

- Docxes Engine: Orchestrates a linear sequence: Source → AST → Metadata Extraction → Compilation → Caching. It is a
  pure data-in, data-out machine.
- Nextra Engine: Orchestrates a tree-based resolution: File Map → Meta.json resolution → Page Layout Injection →
  MDX-to-JS Transformation. It is a filesystem-to-route machine.

Summary
The Docxes Engine is built for Headless Documentation. You use it to turn a folder of MDX into a structured JSON
database that any UI (React, Vue, or even a mobile app) can render. Nextra is a Framework where the processing is the
"glue" between your files and your Next.js routes.
