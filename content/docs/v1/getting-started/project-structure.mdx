A typical DocXes project is organized for clarity and separation of concerns. Since you own the code, it's important to understand where everything lives.

```text
├── content/
│   └── docs/             # Your content lives here
│       └── v1/           # Version folder (required)
├── core/
│   └── engine/           # 🚀 The DocXes Engine Core
├── components/
│   ├── ui/               # Reusable UI primitives (Buttons, Inputs)
│   ├── mdx/              # MDX components (Alerts, CodeBlocks)
├── lib/
│   ├── engine.ts         # Shared engine instance
│   └── configuration.tsx # Config merger
├── marketplace/          # Pre-built Theme Formulas (Shadcn, Curved)
├── x-meta.config.tsx     # ⚙️ Main Configuration File
└── package.json
```

## Key Directories

### `content/docs/`
This is the most important folder for content creators. The structure here directly mirrors your site's sidebar navigation and URL routes.

### `core/engine/`
The heart of DocXes. This framework-agnostic engine handles:
- **Parsing**: MDX parsing and frontmatter extraction.
- **Compiling**: Converting MDX to serializable React code.
- **Navigation**: Automatically building the sidebar tree.
- **Search**: Generating high-performance search indices.

### `x-meta.config.tsx`
The central control panel. Here you define:
- Site Metadata (Title, Description, URL)
- Active Theme (Marketplace formula)
- UI Overrides (Slots for Header, Sidebar, etc.)
- Search Provider Configuration
